        Wayfarer is the third of four projects that students were asked to complete at General Assembly's SEIR course. The goal: Create an app for a (pretend) client where users can leaves reviews about the cities they've visited! For this project, Ryan and Richard were randomly assigned together to create the masterpiece you see before you!

        Hey, I'm Ryan! I masterminded the functionality that allows users to comment to posts, AND to reply to comments!  I also wrote the function that tells users exactly how long ago they commented (just now, 2 minutes ago, etc.).  Pretty cool right!  And a HUGE thanks to everyone who lent us their time to help solve our challenges!  You know who you are!

        Hi, Iâ€™m Richard! I primarily handled the search bar, picture uploading, and CSS styling.  I was particularly satisfied with figuring out how to make the modal pop back up after a user makes a comment. If given more time, I would have focused on improving user experience by auto scrolling to the new/edited comment and highlighting it.  It was great working with Ryan, we made a good team!
